    "1. Organize your data: You should have a dataset that includes pairs of observations for the two variables you want to analyze. In your case, one variable is the amount of time students spend studying for an exam, and the other variable is their final exam scores.\n",

Even if you find a correlation, it doesn't mean that studying more directly causes higher exam scores; there could be other factors at play.
